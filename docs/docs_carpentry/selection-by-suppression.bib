  abstract = {Increased wildfire activity (e.g. number of starts, area burned, fire behaviour) across the western United States in recent decades has heightened interest in resolving climate\textendash{}fire relationships. Macroscale climate\textendash{}fire relationships were examined in forested and non-forested lands for eight Geographic Area Coordination Centers in the western United States, using area burned derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset (1984\textendash{}2010). Fire-specific biophysical variables including fire danger and water balance metrics were considered in addition to standard climate variables of monthly temperature, precipitation and drought indices to explicitly determine their optimal capacity to explain interannual variability in area burned. Biophysical variables tied to the depletion of fuel and soil moisture and prolonged periods of elevated fire-danger had stronger correlations to area burned than standard variables antecedent to or during the fire season, particularly in forested systems. Antecedent climate\textendash{}fire relationships exhibited inter-region commonality with area burned in forested lands correlated with winter snow water equivalent and emergent drought in late spring. Area burned in non-forested lands correlated with moisture availability in the growing season preceding the fire year. Despite differences in the role of antecedent climate in preconditioning fuels, synchronous regional fire activity in forested and non-forested lands suggests that atmospheric conditions during the fire season unify fire activity and can compound or supersede antecedent climatic stressors. Collectively, climate\textendash{}fire relationships viewed through the lens of biophysical variables provide a more direct link to fuel flammability and wildfire activity than standard climate variables, thereby narrowing the gap in incorporating top-down climatic factors between empirical and process-based fire models.},

  abstract = {Successful fire exclusion in the 20th century has created severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire, Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire losses in Western forests.},

  abstract = {Warmer and drier climate over the past few decades has brought larger fire sizes and increased annual area burned in forested ecosystems of western North America, and continued increases in annual area burned are expected due to climate change. As warming continues, fires may also increase in severity and produce larger contiguous patches of severely burned areas. We used remotely sensed burn-severity data from 125 fires in the northern Cascade Range of Washington, USA, to explore relationships between fire size, severity, and the spatial pattern of severity. We examined relationships between climate and the annual area burned and the size of wildfires over a 25-year period. We tested the hypothesis that increased fire size is commensurate with increased burn severity and increased spatial aggregation of severely burned areas. We also asked how local ecological controls might modulate these relationships by comparing results over the whole study area (the northern Cascade Range) to those from four ecological subsections within it. We found significant positive relationships between climate and fire size, and between fire size and the proportion of high severity and spatial-pattern metrics that quantify the spatial aggregation of high-severity areas within fires, but the strength and significance of these relationships varied among the four subsections. In areas with more contiguous subalpine forests and less complex topography, the proportion and spatial aggregation of severely burned areas were more strongly correlated with fire size. If fire sizes increase in a warming climate, changes in the extent, severity, and spatial pattern of fire regimes are likely to be more pronounced in higher-severity fire regimes with less complex topography and more continuous fuels.},

  abstract = {Studies of historical fire and vegetation conditions in dry conifer forests have demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity across landscapes. However, there is a limit to the amount of inference that can be drawn from historical fire reconstructions. Contemporary ``reference'' landscapes may be able to provide information that is not available from historical reconstructions. In this study, we characterized variability in vegetation structure and composition across two Sierra Nevada landscapes with long-established fire restoration programs. We used tree, shrub, and surface fuel data from 117 initial plots, 86 of which were re-measured 8\textendash{}12 years later, to identify the mechanisms driving variability in vegetation and fuel conditions. Our analyses identified nine distinct vegetation groups, with mean live tree basal area and density ranging from 0.3 to 72.7 m2 ha\`A1 and 2.5 to 620 trees ha\`A1 for individual groups. For all plots combined, mean live tree basal area and density was 28.4 m2 ha\`A1 and 215 trees ha\`A1, but standard deviations (SD) were 29.1 m2 ha\`A1 and 182 trees ha\`A1, respectively. These ranges and SDs demonstrate considerable variability in vegetation structure, which was partially related to site productivity and previous fire severity. Fine surface fuel loads were generally low (overall mean, 16.1 Mg ha\`A1), but also exhibited high variability (SD, 12.6 Mg ha\`A1). Surprisingly, surface fuel loads based on initial measurement and change between measurements were not related to fire characteristics. The only statistical relationship found was that surface fuel loads were associated with forest structure and composition. These results capture a contemporary `natural' range of variability and can be used to guide landscape-level restoration efforts. More specifically, these results can help identify distinct targets for variable forest structures across landscapes.},

  abstract = {In areas where fire regimes and forest structure have been dramatically altered, there is increasing concern that contemporary fires have the potential to set forests on a positive feedback trajectory with successive reburns, one in which extensive stand-\- replacing fire could promote more stand-r\-eplacing fire. Our study utilized an extensive set of field plots established following four fires that occurred between 2000 and 2010 in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA that were subsequently reburned in 2012. The information obtained from these field plots allowed for a unique set of analyses investigating the effect of vegetation, fuels, topography, fire weather, and forest management on reburn severity. We also examined the influence of initial fire severity and time since initial fire on influential predictors of reburn severity. Our results suggest that high-\-to moderate-\- severity fire in the initial fires led to an increase in standing snags and shrub vegetation, which in combination with severe fire weather promoted high-s\-everity fire effects in the subsequent reburn. Although fire behavior is largely driven by weather, our study demonstrates that post-f\-ire vegetation composition and structure are also important drivers of reburn severity. In the face of changing climatic regimes and increases in extreme fire weather, these results may provide managers with options to create more fire-\-resilient ecosystems. In areas where frequent high-\-severity fire is undesirable, management activities such as thinning, prescribed fire, or managed wildland fire can be used to moderate fire behavior not only prior to initial fires, but also before subsequent reburns.},

We also tested for temporal trends in landscape patterns.
Results Landscape patterns of stand-replacing fire were strongly controlled by fire size and proportion stand-replacing, which were, in turn, controlled by climate/weather and vegetation/topography, respectively. From 1984 to 2010, the proportion of standreplacing fire within burn perimeters increased from 0.22 to 0.27. Trends for other landscape metrics were not significant, but may respond to further increases proportion stand-replacing fire.
Conclusions Fires from 1984 to 2010 exhibited tremendous heterogeneity in landscape patterns of stand-replacing fire, likely promoting resilience in burned areas. If trends continue on the current trajectory, however, fires may produce larger and simpler shaped patches of stand-replacing fire with more burned area far from seed sources.},

  abstract = {Wildfire regimes in natural forest ecosystems have been characterized with power\textendash{}law distributions. In this paper, we evaluated whether wildfire regimes in a human-dominated landscape were also consistent with power\textendash{}law distributions. Our case study focused on wildfires in Florida, a state with rapid population growth and consequent rapid alteration of forest ecosystems and natural fire regimes. We found that all fire size\textendash{}frequency distributions evaluated in this study were consistent with power\textendash{}law distributions, but the power\textendash{}law distributions were piece-wise linear. A kink in the power\textendash{}law distributions occurred at about 640 ha for flatwoods fires and at about 290 ha for swamp fires. Above these levels, fires ``exploded'' into a catastrophic regime. If the kink represents the level at which fires become immune to fire suppression effort, we would expect that the location of the kink would occur at smaller fire sizes during extreme fire years due to the increased flammability of fuels and the relative scarcity of fire suppression resources. We found this result for three of four extreme fire years in flatwoods ecosystems and for all four extreme fire years in swamps. These results suggest that catastrophic fires may not be possible to prevent and that suppression efforts during extreme fire years may be best applied to strategic areas that decrease the connectivity of fuels.},

  abstract = {Fire suppression and past logging have dramatically altered forest conditions in many areas, but changes to within-stand tree spatial patterns over time are not as well understood. The few studies available suggest that variability in tree spatial patterns is an important structural feature of forests with intact frequent fire regimes that should be incorporated in restoration prescriptions. We used a rare dataset consisting of mapped locations for all trees P10 cm in three 4-ha plots in 1929 before logging and in 2007/2008, 78 and 79 years after logging, to assess changes in three spatial components of forest structure: individual trees, tree clusters and gaps. Comparing 1929 old growth to modern conditions, area in gaps decreased from 20\% to zero, the percentage of stems that were single trees from 6\% to 2\% and in small or medium clumps (2\textendash{}9 trees) from 28\% to 9\%, while trees in large clumps (P10 trees) increased from 66\% to 89\%. Concurrent with these changes, canopy cover increased from 45\% to 62\%, and the average number of trees in a clump increased from 11 to 26, resulting in much more homogenous conditions across the stand. These changes also altered tree size and species associations within different structural groups (i.e., single tree, small, medium and large clumps). In an effort to account for the alteration of the fire regime that had already taken place in 1929 (the last fire recorded in tree rings was in 1889) we also analyzed spatial patterns of 1929 conditions removing all trees {$<$}25 cm. In this analysis, 35\% of the plot area was in gaps and canopy cover averaged 36\%. Tree clusters had an average of 5.2 trees per clump, with 13\% of trees being singles, 30\% in small clumps, 24\% in medium clumps and 33\% in large clumps. Our results provide metrics that quantify spatial patterns and composition of individual trees, tree clumps, and gaps under the historical fire regime that may be useful to forest managers. Our study demonstrates that the contemporary forest is more homogeneous than it was historically, and variability that likely provided diverse microclimate and habitat conditions and fostered resilience to a variety of stressors and disturbances such as fire, insects and drought has been lost. Future management may benefit from restoring these structural components.},

  abstract = {Following changes in vegetation structure and pattern, along with a changing climate, large wildfire incidence has increased in forests throughout the western United States. Given this increase, there is great interest in whether fuels treatments and previous wildfire can alter fire severity patterns in large wildfires. We assessed the relative influence of previous fuels treatments (including wildfire), fire weather, vegetation, and water balance on fire-severity in the Rim Fire of 2013. We did this at three different spatial scales to investigate whether the influences on fire severity changed across scales. Both fuels treatments and previous low to moderate-severity wildfire reduced the prevalence of high-severity fire. In general, areas without recent fuels treatments and areas that previously burned at high severity tended to have a greater proportion of high-severity fire in the Rim Fire. Areas treated with prescribed fire, especially when combined with thinning, had the lowest proportions of high severity. The proportion of the landscape burned at high severity was most strongly influenced by fire weather and proportional area previously treated for fuels or burned by low to moderate severity wildfire. The proportion treated needed to effectively reduce the amount of high severity fire varied by spatial scale of analysis, with smaller spatial scales requiring a greater proportion treated to see an effect on fire severity. When moderate and high-severity fire encountered a previously treated area, fire severity was significantly reduced in the treated area relative to the adjacent untreated area. Our results show that fuels treatments and low to moderateseverity wildfire can reduce fire severity in a subsequent wildfire, even when burning under fire growth conditions. These results serve as further evidence that both fuels treatments and lower severity wildfire can increase forest resilience.},

  abstract = {Acute changes in ecological disturbance regimes can have major consequences for ecosystems and biota, including humans, living within them. Human suppression of fire in the western United States over the last century has caused notable changes to many ecosystems, especially in lower elevation, semiarid forest types dominated historically by fire tolerant taxa like Pinus and Quercus. Recent increases in fire activity in western US forests have highlighted the need for restoration of ecological structure and function, but management targets for restoration in different forest types remain uncertain. Working in the forests of eastern California, we evaluated the direction and magnitude of change in burned area and fire severity between the period prior to Euro-American settlement (;1500\textendash{}1850) and the ``modern'' period (1984\textendash{}2009). We compared total annual area burned; proportional area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity; and annual area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity between the two time periods in seven forest types. We also examined modern trends in fire area and severity. We found that modern rates of burning are far below presettlement levels for all forest types. However, there were major differences between low to middle elevation forests and high elevation forests regarding the components of this departure. Low and middle elevation forests are currently burning at much higher severities than during the presettlement period, and the departure in fire area is overwhelmingly expressed in the low to moderate severity categories; in these forest types, mean annual area of high severity fire is not notably different between the modern and presettlement periods. In higher elevation forests on the other hand, the modern departure in fire area is expressed equally across fire severity categories. Our results underline the critical need for forest and fire restoration in the study area, especially in low and middle elevation forests adapted to frequent, low severity fire. Expanded management of naturally ignited fires for resource benefit is clearly needed, but in many parts of our study area, strategic reduction of forest fuels will likely be necessary before large-scale restoration of fire becomes ecologically, politically, and financially feasible.},

  abstract = {Multi-temporal change detection is commonly used in the detection of changes to ecosystems. Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events.},

  abstract = {Fire is a major agent of spatial pattern formation in forests, as it creates a mosaic of burned and unburned patches. While most research has focused on landscape-level patterns created by crown fires, millions of hectares of forests in North America are subject to surface fire regimes. A spatially explicit forest gap model developed for the Sierra Nevada was used to evaluate the influence of surface fire regimes on the heterogeneity of forest structure and composition within forest stands. Forest pattern was evaluated for a wide range of topographic positions in Sequoia National Park, California, to determine if repeated surface fires amplify existing spatial patterns. The spatial heterogeneity of some forest characteristics increased under a simulated fire regime relative to scenarios without fire. Although a distinct and regular fire-generated spatial pattern was not detected with an analysis of spatial autocorrelation, simulated surface fires did alter the spatial heterogeneity within a forest stand, primarily by degrading a regular structure that is imposed by competition for light in the absence of fire. The interaction between surface fires and forest pattern may be qualitatively different from that which occurs in forests subject to crown fires. As such, what has been learned about forests dominated by crown fires may not apply to forests subject to surface fire regimes.},

  abstract = {Forests contain the world's largest terrestrial carbon stocks, but in seasonally dry environments stock stability can be compromised if burned by wildfire, emitting carbon back to the atmosphere. Treatments to reduce wildfire severity can reduce emissions, but with an immediate cost of reducing carbon stocks. In this study we examine the tradeoffs in carbon stock reduction and wildfire emissions in 19 fuels-treated and -untreated forests burned in twelve wildfires. The fuels treatment, a commonly used thinning `from below' and removal of activity fuels, removed an average of 50.3 Mg C ha-1 or 34\% of live tree carbon stocks. Wildfire emissions averaged 29.7 and 67.8 Mg C ha-1 in fuels treated and untreated forests, respectively. The total carbon (fuels treatment plus wildfire emission) removed from treated sites was 119\% of the carbon emitted from the untreated/burned sites. However, with only 3\% tree survival following wildfire, untreated forests averaged only 7.8 Mg C ha-1 in live trees with an average quadratic mean tree diameter of 21 cm. In contrast, treated forest averaged 100.5 Mg C ha-1 with a live tree quadratic mean diameter of 44 cm. In untreated forests 70\% of the remaining total ecosystem carbon shifted to decomposing stocks after the wildfire, compared to 19\% in the fuels-treated forest. In wildfire burned forest, fuels treatments have a higher immediate carbon `cost', but in the long-term may benefit from lower decomposition emissions and higher carbon storage.},

  abstract = {Fire regime characteristics in North America are expected to change over the next several decades as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Although some fire regime characteristics (e.g., area burned and fire season length) are relatively well-studied in the context of a changing climate, fire severity has received less attention. In this study, we used observed data from 1984 to 2012 for the western United States (US) to build a statistical model of fire severity as a function of climate. We then applied this model to several (n=20) climate change projections representing mid-century (2040\textendash{}2069) conditions under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Model predictions suggest widespread reduction in fire severity for large portions of the western US. However, our model implicitly incorporates climateinduced changes in vegetation type, fuel load, and fire frequency. As such, our predictions are best interpreted as a potential reduction in fire severity, a potential that may not be realized due humaninduced disequilibrium between plant communities and climate. Consequently, to realize the reductions in fire severity predicted in this study, land managers in the western US could facilitate the transition of plant communities towards a state of equilibrium with the emerging climate through means such as active restoration treatments (e.g., mechanical thinning and prescribed fire) and passive restoration strategies like managed natural fire (under suitable weather conditions). Resisting changes in vegetation composition and fuel load via activities such as aggressive fire suppression will amplify disequilibrium conditions and will likely result in increased fire severity in future decades because fuel loads will increase as the climate warms and fire danger becomes more extreme. The results of our study provide insights to the pros and cons of resisting or facilitating change in vegetation composition and fuel load in the context of a changing climate.},

Complex interactions at multiple scales between fire, fuels, topography, and weather make these predictions extremely difficult. We define a new fire weather index called the Hot-Dry-Windy Index (HDW). HDW uses the basic science of how the atmosphere can affect a fire to define the meteorological variables that can be predicted at synoptic-and meso-alpha-scales that govern the potential for the atmosphere to affect a fire. The new index is formulated to account for meteorological conditions both at the Earth's surface and in a 500-m layer just above the surface. HDW is defined and then compared with the Haines Index (HI) for four historical fires. The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) is used to provide the meteorological data for calculating the indices. Our results indicate that HDW can identify days on which synoptic-and meso-alpha-scale weather processes can contribute to especially dangerous fire behavior. HDW is shown to perform better than the HI for each of the four historical fires. Additionally, since HDW is based on the meteorological variables that govern the potential for the atmosphere to affect a fire, it is possible to speculate on why HDW would be more or less effective based on the conditions that prevail in a given fire case. The HI, in contrast, does not have a physical basis, which makes speculation on why it works or does not work difficult because the mechanisms are not clear.},

  abstract = {Fire is one of the most important natural disturbance processes in the western United States and ecosystems differ markedly with respect to their ecological and evolutionary relationships with fire. Reference fire regimes in forested ecosystems can be categorized along a gradient ranging from ``fuellimited'' to ``climate-limited'' where the former types are often characterized by frequent, lower-severity wildfires and the latter by infrequent, more severe wildfires. Using spatial data on fire severity from 1984\textendash{}2011 and metrics related to fire frequency, we tested how divergence from historic (pre-Euroamerican settlement) fire frequencies due to a century of fire suppression influences rates of high-severity fire in five forest types in California. With some variation among bioregions, our results suggest that fires in forest types characterized by fuel-limited fire regimes (e.g., yellow pine and mixed conifer forest) tend to burn with greater proportions of high-severity fire as either time since last fire or the mean modern fire return interval (FRI) increases. Two intermediate fire regime types (mixed evergreen and bigcone Douglas-fir) showed a similar relationship between fire frequency and fire severity. However, red fir and redwood forests, which are characterized by more climate-limited fire regimes, did not show significant positive relationships between FRI and fire severity. This analysis provides strong evidence that for fuel-limited fire regimes, lack of fire leads to increasing rates of high-severity burning. Our study also substantiates the general validity of ``fuel-limited'' vs. ``climate-limited'' explanations of differing patterns of fire effects and response in forest types of the western US.},

The recent tree mortality has many implications for the future of these forests and the ecological goods and services they provide to society. Future wildfire hazard following this mortality can be generally characterized by decreased crown fire potential and increased surface fire intensity in the short to intermediate term. The scale of present tree mortality is so large that greater potential for ``mass fire'' exists in the coming decades, driven by the amount and continuity of dry, combustible, large woody material that could produce large, severe fires. For long-term adaptation to climate change, we highlight the importance of moving beyond triage of dead and dying trees to making ``green'' (live) forests more resilient.},

In forests where regeneration following stand-replacing fire depends on seed dispersal from surviving trees, the size and shape of stand-replacing patches are critical metrics that are difficult to describe and often overlooked. We used a novel, recently-developed metric that describes the amount of stand-replacing area within a given distance of a live-tree patch edge, in order to compare fires that may be otherwise similar in fire size or the percentage of stand-replacing effects. Specifically, we analyzed 477 fires in California pine, fir, and mixed-conifer forests between 1984 and 2015 and asked whether this metric, the stand-replacing decay coefficient (SDC), has changed over time, whether it is affected by fire management, and how it responds to extreme weather conditions at the time of the fire. Mean annual SDC became smaller over time (significantly so in the Sierra Nevada region), indicating that stand-replacing patches became larger and more regularly shaped. The decrease in SDC was particularly pronounced in the years since 2011. While SDC is correlated with percent highseverity, it is able to distinguish fires of comparable percent high-severity but different spatial pattern, with fires managed for suppression having smaller SDC than fires managed for resource benefit. Similarly, fires managed by the US Forest Service had smaller SDC than fires managed by the National Park Service. Fire weather also played an important role, with higher maximum temperatures generally associated with smaller SDC values. SDC is useful for comparing fires because it is associated with more conventional metrics such as percent highseverity, but also incorporates a measure of regeneration potential \textendash{} distance to surviving trees at stand-replacement patch edges \textendash{} which is a biological legacy that directly affects the resilience of forests to increasingly frequent and severe fire disturbances. We estimate that from 1984 to 2015, over 80,000 ha of forestland burned with stand-replacing effects greater than 120 m in from patch edges, denoting areas vulnerable to extended conifer forest loss due to dispersal limitation. Managing unplanned ignitions under less extreme weather conditions can achieve beneficial ``fine-grained'' effects of stand-replacing fire where regeneration limitation is less of a concern. Because SDC is a useful single metric to compare fires, we introduce a web application (stevensjt.shinyapps.io/sdc\_app) to calculate SDC for any high-severity spatial layer that may be of interest.},

We used a multi-regional dataset of 1485 sites across 52 wildfires from the US Rocky Mountains to ask if and how changing climate over the last several decades impacted post-fire tree regeneration, a key indicator of forest resilience. Results highlight significant decreases in tree regeneration in the 21st century. Annual moisture deficits were significantly greater from 2000 to 2015 as compared to 1985\textendash{}1999, suggesting increasingly unfavourable post-fire growing conditions, corresponding to significantly lower seedling densities and increased regeneration failure. Dry forests that already occur at the edge of their climatic tolerance are most prone to conversion to non-forests after wildfires. Major climate-induced reduction in forest density and extent has important consequences for a myriad of ecosystem services now and in the future.},

  abstract = {In the context of ongoing climatic warming, certain landscapes could be near a tipping point where relatively small changes to their fire regimes or their postfire forest recovery dynamics could bring about extensive forest loss, with associated effects on biodiversity and carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate change. Such concerns are particularly valid in the Klamath Region of northern California and southwestern Oregon, where severe fire initially converts montane conifer forests to systems dominated by broadleaf trees and shrubs. Conifers eventually overtop the competing vegetation, but until they do, these systems could be perpetuated by a cycle of reburning. To assess the vulnerability of conifer forests to increased fire activity and altered forest recovery dynamics in a warmer, drier climate, we characterized vegetation dynamics following severe fire in nine fire years over the last three decades across the climatic aridity gradient of montane conifer forests. Postfire conifer recruitment was limited to a narrow window, with 89\% of recruitment in the first 4 years, and height growth tended to decrease as the lag between the fire year and the recruitment year increased. Growth reductions at longer lags were more pronounced at drier sites, where conifers comprised a smaller portion of live woody biomass. An interaction between seed-source availability and climatic aridity drove substantial variation in the density of regenerating conifers. With increasing climatic water deficit, higher propagule pressure (i.e., smaller patch sizes for high-severity fire) was needed to support a given conifer seedling density, which implies that projected future increases in aridity could limit postfire regeneration across a growing portion of the landscape. Under a more severe prospective warming scenario, by the end of the century more than half of the area currently capable of supporting montane conifer forest could become subject to minimal conifer regeneration in even moderate-sized (10s of ha) high-severity patches.},

  abstract = {Extensive high-severity wildfires have driven major losses of ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests in the southwestern United States, in some settings catalyzing enduring conversions to nonforested vegetation types. Management interventions to reduce the probability of stand-replacing wildfire have included mechanical fuel treatments, prescribed fire, and wildfire managed for resource benefit. In 2011, the Las Conchas fire in northern New Mexico burned forested areas not exposed to fire for {$>$}100 yr, but also reburned numerous prescribed fire units and/or areas previously burned by wildfire. At some sites, the combination of recent prescribed fire and wildfire approximated known pre-settlement fire frequency, with two or three exposures to fire between 1977 and 2007. We analyzed gridded remotely sensed burn severity data (differenced normalized burn ratio), pre- and post-fire field vegetation samples, and pre- and post-fire measures of surface fuels to assess relationships and interactions between prescribed fire, prior wildfire, fuels, subsequent burn severity, and patterns of post-fire forest retention vs. conversion to non-forest. We found that Las Conchas burn severity was lowest, and tree survival was highest, in sites that had experienced both prescribed fire and prior wildfire. Sites that had experienced only prescribed or prior wildfire exhibited moderate burn severity and intermediate levels of forest retention. Sites lacking any recent prior fire burned at the highest severity and were overwhelmingly converted to non-forested vegetation including grassland, oak scrub, and weedy, herbaceous-dominated types. Burn severity in the Las Conchas fire was closely linked to surface woody fuel loads, which were reduced by prior wildfire and prescribed fire. Our results support the restoration of fire regimes via prescribed fire and resource benefit wildfire to promote the resiliency of forest types vulnerable to fire-mediated type conversion. The application of prescribed fire to reduce surface fuels following wildfire may reduce forest loss during subsequent fire under more extreme conditions. These findings are especially relevant given likely increases in vulnerability associated with climate change impacts to wildfire and forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Due to fire suppression policies, timber harvest, and other management practices over the last century, many low- to mid-elevation forests in semiarid parts of the western United States have accumulated high fuel loads and dense, multi-layered canopies that are dominated by shade-tolerant and firesensitive conifers. To a great extent, the future status of western US forests will depend on tree species' responses to patterns and trends in fire activity and fire behavior and postfire management decisions. This is especially the case in the North American Mediterranean-climate zone (NAMCZ), which supports the highest precipitation variability in North America and a 4- to 6-month annual drought, and has seen greater-than-average increases in air temperature and fire activity over the last three decades. We established 1490 survey plots in 14 burned areas on 10 National Forests across a range of elevations, forest types, and fire severities in the central and northern NAMCZ to provide insight into factors that promote natural tree regeneration after wildfires and the differences in postfire responses of the most common conifer species. We measured site characteristics, seedling densities, woody shrub, and tree growth. We specified a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed model with random effects to understand the importance of each measured variable in predicting conifer regeneration. Across all fires, 43\% of all plots had no conifer regeneration. Ten of the 14 fires had median conifer seedling densities that did not meet Forest Service stocking density thresholds for mixed conifer forests. When regeneration did occur, it was dominated by shadetolerant but fire-sensitive firs (Abies spp.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). Seedling densities of conifer species were lowest in sites that burned at high severity, principally due to the biotic consequences of high severity fire, for example, increased distances to live seed trees and competition with fire-following shrubs. We developed a second model specifically for forest managers and restoration practitioners who work in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests in the central NAMCZ to assess potential natural regeneration in the years immediately following a fire, allowing them to prioritize which areas may need active postfire forest restoration and supplemental planting.},

Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and sequential autoregression (SAR) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildfires: the Camp 32 fire in western Montana, the School fire in southeastern Washington, and the Warm fire in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the LANDFIRE project were used to control for prefire variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three fires, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the SAR models than in the OLS models. Spatial error terms in the SAR models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the LANDFIRE data, including spatiotemporal variability in fire weather and landscape-level effects of reduced fire severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

However, little is known of the ecological impacts of large fires on both historical and contemporary landscapes. The present paper presents a review of the current knowledge of the effects of large fires in the United States by important ecosystems written by regional experts. The ecosystems are (1) ponderosa pine\textendash{}Douglas-fir, (2) sagebrush\textendash{}grasslands, (3) pi\~non\textendash{}juniper, (4) chaparral, (5) mixed-conifer, and (6) spruce\textendash{}fir. This review found that large fires were common on most historical western US landscapes and they will continue to be common today with exceptions. Sagebrush ecosystems are currently experiencing larger, more severe, and more frequent large fires compared to historical conditions due to exotic cheatgrass invasions. Historical large fires in south-west ponderosa pine forest created a mixed severity mosaic dominated by non-lethal surface fires while today's large fires are mostly high severity crown fires. While large fires play an important role in landscape ecology for most regions, their importance is much less in the dry pi\~non\textendash{}juniper forests and sagebrush\textendash{}grasslands. Fire management must address the role of large fires in maintaining the health of many US fire-dominated ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The long-term persistence of forest ecosystems hinges on their resilience to ongoing disturbance. Quantification of resilience in these valuable ecosystems remains difficult due to their vast extent and the longevity of forest species. Resilience to wildfire may arise from feedback between fire behavior and vegetation structure, which dictates fuel loading and continuity. Regular fire generates structural variability which may then enable forests to withstand future fires and retain their fundamental properties and functions-- a hallmark of a resilient system. A century of fire suppression in the western United States has homogenized the structure of many forests, potentially upsetting these feedbacks and compromising forest resilience. We investigate the generality and scale of the effect of structural variability on wildfire behavior in yellow pine/mixed-conifer forest of California's Sierra Nevada using cloud computing and texture analysis of a 33-year time series of satellite imagery. We measure wildfire response to forest structure for an unprecedented number and size range of wildfires, ensuring representation of both typical and extreme fire behavior, and find that greater structural variability is strongly associated with a lower probability of fire-induced overstory tree mortality. This resistance to wildfire was most apparent at the smallest spatial extent of forest structure tested (90m x 90m). Local-scale structural variability thus links past and future fire behavior, and makes forests more resilient to wildfire disturbance. Management strategies that increase vegetation structural variability, such as allowing fires to burn under moderate fuel and weather conditions, may therefore increase the probability of long-term forest persistence.},

  abstract = {Large wildfires ({$>$}40 ha) account for the majority of burned area across the contiguous United States (US) and appropriate substantial suppression resources. A variety of environmental and social factors influence wildfire growth and whether a fire overcomes initial attack efforts and becomes a large wildfire. However, little is known about how these factors differ between lightning-caused and human-caused wildfires. This study examines differences in temperature, vapour pressure deficit, fuel moisture and wind speed for large and small lightning- and human-caused wildfires during the initial days of fire activity at ecoregion scales across the US. Large fires of both human and lightning origin occurred coincident with above-normal temperature and vapour pressure deficit and below-normal 100-hour dead fuel moisture compared with small fires. Large human-caused wildfires occurred, on average, coincident with higher wind speeds than small human-caused wildfires and large lightning-caused wildfires. These results suggest the importance of winds in driving rapid fire growth that can allow fires to overcome many of the factors that typically inhibit large human-caused fires. Additionally, such findings highlight the interplay between human activity and meteorological conditions and the importance of incorporating winds in modelling large-fire risk in human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Wildfires are becoming more frequent in parts of the globe, but predicting where and when wildfires occur remains difficult. To predict wildfire extremes across the contiguous United States, we integrate a 30 year wildfire record with meteorological and housing data in spatiotemporal Bayesian statistical models with spatially varying nonlinear effects. We compared different distributions for the number and sizes of large fires to generate a posterior predictive distribution based on finite sample maxima for extreme events (the largest fires over bounded spatiotemporal domains). A zero-inflated negative binomial model for fire counts and a lognormal model for burned areas provided the best performance. This model attains 99\% interval coverage for the number of fires and 93\% coverage for fire sizes over a six year withheld data set. Dryness and air temperature strongly predict extreme wildfire probabilities. Housing density has a hump-shaped relationship with fire occurrence, with more fires occurring at intermediate housing densities. Statistically, these drivers affect the chance of an extreme wildfire in two ways: by altering fire size distributions, and by altering fire frequency, which influences sampling from the tails of fire size distributions. We conclude that recent extremes should not be surprising, and that the contiguous United States may be on the verge of even larger wildfire extremes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {More than 70 years of fire suppression by federal land management agencies has interrupted fire regimes in much of the western United States. The result of missed fire cycles is a buildup of both surface and canopy fuels in many forest ecosystems, increasing the risk of severe fire. The frequency and size of fires has increased in recent decades, as has the area burned with high severity in some ecosystems. A number of studies have examined controls on high severity fire occurrence, but none have yet determined what controls the extent of high severity fire. We developed statistical models predicting high severity area burned for the western United States and three sub-regions\textemdash{}the Northern Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Southwest. A simple model with maximum temperature the month of fire, annual normalized moisture deficit and location explains area burned in high severity fire in our west-wide model, with the exception of years with especially large areas burned with high severity fire: 1988, 2002. With respect to mitigation or management of high severity fire, understanding what drives extreme fire years is critical. For the sub-regional models, topography, spring temperature and snowpack condition, and vegetation condition class variables improved our prediction of high severity burned area in extreme fire years. Fire year climate is critical to predicting area burned in high severity fire, especially in extreme fire years. These models can be used for scenario analyses and impact assessments to aid management in mitigating negative impacts of high severity fire.},

Most recent empirical studies of multivariate selection have employed multiple linear regression to obtain estimates of the strength of selection. We reconsider the motivation for this approach, paying special attention to the effects of nonnormal traits and fitness measures. We apply an alternative statistical method, logistic regression, to estimate the strength of selection on multiple phenotypic traits. First, we argue that the logistic regression model is more suitable than linear regression for analyzing data from selection studies with dichotomous fitness outcomes. Subsequently, we show that estimates of selection obtained from the logistic regression analyses can be transformed easily to values that directly plug into equations describing adaptive microevolutionary change. Finally, we apply this methodology to two published datasets to demonstrate its utility. Because most statistical packages now provide options to conduct logistic regression analyses, we suggest that this approach should be widely adopted as an analytical tool for empirical studies of multivariate selection.},

  shorttitle = {Fire Intensity, Fire Severity and Burn Severity},
  abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

Indirect costs of this achievement include the development of dense vegetation in the absence of fire, and increasingly more intense fires when they do erupt. The result is a fire management system with rising costs and fire-dependent forests that are frequently characterized by declining health. Wildland fire use (WFU), the use of fire to accomplish specific pre-stated resource management objectives, is considered appropriate in many remote wildlands where a naturally ignited fire may safely be used to improve forest health. Ecological benefits associated with WFU include improved watershed conditions, enhanced wildlife habitat, and more resilient forested ecosystems. Economic benefits include reduced suppression and fuels treatment costs over the long term. Policy challenges are complex, however; land management agencies face increased planning requirements as well as the need to develop both institutional and public support before the full potential of wildland fire use can be realized.},

This paper synthesizes current understanding of disturbance with an emphasis on fundamental contributions to contemporary landscape and ecosystem ecology, then identifies future research priorities. Studies of disturbance led to insights about heterogeneity, scale, and thresholds in space and time and catalyzed new paradigms in ecology. Because they create vegetation patterns, disturbances also establish spatial patterns of many ecosystem processes on the landscape. Drivers of global change will produce new spatial patterns, altered disturbance regimes, novel trajectories of change, and surprises. Future disturbances will continue to provide valuable opportunities for studying pattern-process interactions. Changing disturbance regimes will produce acute changes in ecosystems and ecosystem services over the short (years to decades) and long-term (centuries and beyond). Future research should address questions related to (1) disturbances as catalysts of rapid ecological change, (2) interactions among disturbances, (3) relationships between disturbance and society, especially the intersection of land use and disturbance, and (4) feedbacks from disturbance to other global drivers. Ecologists should make a renewed and concerted effort to understand and anticipate the causes and consequences of changing disturbance regimes.},

In this study, we estimated one component of that benefit \textendash{} the expected present value of the reduction in suppression costs for subsequent fires arising from the fuel treatment effect of a current fire. To that end, we employed Monte Carlo methods to generate a set of scenarios for subsequent fire ignition and weather events, which are referred to as sample paths, for a study area in central Oregon. We simulated fire on the landscape over a 100-year time horizon using existing models of fire behaviour, vegetation and fuels development, and suppression effectiveness, and we estimated suppression costs using an existing suppression cost model. Our estimates suggest that the potential cost savings may be substantial. Further research is needed to estimate the full least-cost-plus-net-value-change model.

  abstract = {[A general framework is presented to unify diverse models of natural selection. This framework is based on the Price Equation, with two additional steps. First, characters are described by their multiple regression on a set of predictor variables. The most common predictors in genetics are alleles and their interactions, but any predictor may be used. The second step is to describe fitness by multiple regression on characters. Once again, characters may be chosen arbitrarily. This expanded Price Equation provides an exact description of total evolutionary change under all conditions, and for all systems of inheritance and selection. The model is first used for a new proof of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. The relations are then made clear among Fisher's theorem, Robertson's covariance theorem for quantitative genetics, the Lande-Arnold model for the causal analysis of natural selection, and Hamilton's rule for kin selection. Each of these models is a partial analysis of total evolutionary change. The Price Equation extends each model to an exact, total analysis of evolutionary change for any system of inheritance and selection. This exact analysis is used to develop an expanded Hamilton's rule for total change. The expanded rule clarifies the distinction between two types of kin selection coefficients. The first measures components of selection caused by correlated phenotypes of social partners. The second measures components of heritability via transmission by direct and indirect components of fitness.]},

This study examined the nature and evolution of the news media discussion and debate about these policy initiatives. Computer content analysis was used to analyse favourable and unfavourable beliefs about HFI/HFRA expressed in about 2800 news stories and editorials published from August 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004. The most frequently mentioned favourable beliefs that emerged included the view that HFI/HFRA will (1) reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire, (2) protect people, communities, and property, and (3) cut red tape and speed up decision making processes. The most commonly expressed unfavourable beliefs included the view that HFI/HFRA (1) is an excuse to increase logging, (2) will weaken environmental protections, and (3) will reduce public input. Some evidence was found of a gradual shift in the media discussion to a more favourable view of HFI/HFRA over time. The Bush administration's framing of its HFI as essential for reducing dangerous levels of fuels in forests and lowering the risk of catastrophic wildfires slowly gained ground and became the dominant discourse, but mistrust was found to be an ongoing issue as the HFRA is implemented.},

It offers an overview of federal fire policy, describing the evolution of that policy and how the current forest health debate has shaped policy options. It reviews and analyzes the legal framework governing fire policy on public lands, focusing on relevant organic legislation and site-specific statutes, the interface between environmental law and fire management including recent Healthy Forests Initiative reforms, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, tort liability and other compensation doctrines, and the role of state law in shaping federal policy. It then places the fire policy debate in a broader public land policy context, arguing that the current legal framework is not fundamentally flawed though some reforms are necessary to better accommodate fire on the public domain. It concludes that clear legal standards and procedures are necessary to ensure legitimacy and promote accountability in the uncertain and risk-laden wildfire policy setting.},

Maximizing the amount of Fisher information about the environment captured by the population leads to Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, the most profound statement about how natural selection influences evolutionary dynamics. I also show a relation between Fisher information and Shannon information (entropy) that may help to unify the correspondence between information and dynamics.

  abstract = {Disturbance such as wildfire may create opportunities for plant communities to reorganize in response to climate change. The interaction between climate change and disturbance may be particularly important in forests, where many of the foundational plant species (trees) are long-lived and where poor initial tree establishment can result in conversion to shrub- or graminoid-dominated systems. The response of post-disturbance vegetation establishment to post-disturbance weather conditions, particularly to extreme weather, could therefore provide useful information about how forest communities will respond to climate change. We examined the effect of post-fire weather conditions on post-fire tree, shrub, and graminoid recruitment in fire-adapted forests in northern California, USA, by surveying regenerating vegetation in severely burned areas 4\textendash{}5 yr after 14 different wildfires that burned between 2004 and 2012. This time period (2004\textendash{}2016) encompassed a wide range of post-fire weather conditions, including a period of extreme drought. For the most common tree species, we observed little evidence of disturbance-mediated community reorganization or range shifts but instead either (1) low sensitivity of recruitment to post-fire weather or (2) weak but widespread decreases in recruitment under unusually dry post-fire conditions, depending on the species. The occurrence of a single strong drought year following fire was more important than a series of moderately dry years in explaining tree recruitment declines. Overall, however, post-fire tree recruitment patterns were explained more strongly by long-term climate and topography and local adult tree species abundance than by post-fire weather conditions. This observation suggests that surviving adult trees can contribute to a ``biological inertia'' that restricts the extent to which tree community composition will track changes in climate through post-disturbance recruitment. In contrast to our observations in trees, we observed substantial increases in shrub and graminoid establishment under post-fire drought, suggesting that shifts in dominance between functional groups may become more likely in a future with more frequent and intense drought.},

  abstract = {California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create {$\sim$}100\% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm\textendash{}dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the ``exceptional'' 2012\textendash{}2014 drought in California.},

  abstract = {Climate science has advanced over decades from an initial focus on the development and use of numerical models of Earth's climate and compilation of rich networks of observational data, to now being in a position to ``detect'' and ``attribute'' specific impacts and events to anthropogenic climate change. Recent analyses have thus established the ``fingerprint'' of anthropogenic climate change in an increasingly diverse array of meteorological and hydrological phenomena around the world, from heat waves to coastal damages during extreme tides and storms, flooding from more intense precipitation events, and severe drought (1). In a new study published in PNAS, Diffenbaugh et al. now add weight to the accumulating evidence that anthropogenic climatic changes are already influencing the frequency, magnitude, and duration of drought in California (2). The authors show that the increasing co-occurrence of dry years with warm years raises the risk of drought despite limited evidence of a trend in precipitation itself, highlighting the critical role of elevated temperatures in altering water availability and increasing overall drought intensity and impact.

California's nickname is the Golden State, a name that owes as much to the golden hue of its landscapes during the dry summer season as to the 19th century Gold Rush or the fields of golden poppies. The grasses green up again in late fall when the midlatitude storms and rainfall return. What happens if those rains come late, come little, or in some cases don't come at all? Such has been the case in recent years.

California is experiencing extreme drought. Measured both by precipitation and by runoff in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins, 10 of the past 14 y have been below normal, and the past \ldots{}

The warmer and windier conditions corresponding to a 2 \texttimes{} CO2 climate scenario produced fires that burned more intensely and spread faster in most locations. Despite enhancement of fire suppression efforts, the number of escaped fires (those exceeding initial containment limits) increased 51\% in the south San Francisco Bay area, 125\% in the Sierra Nevada, and did not change on the north coast. Changes in area burned by contained fires were 41\%, 41\% and \textendash{}8\%, respectively. When interpolated to most of northern California's wildlands, these results translate to an average annual increase of 114 escapes (a doubling of the current frequency) and an additional 5,000 hectares (a 50\% increase) burned by contained fires. On average, the fire return intervals in grass and brush vegetation types were cut in half. The estimates reported represent a minimum expected change, or best-case forecast. In addition to the increased suppression costs and economic damages, changes in fire severity of this magnitude would have widespread impacts on vegetation distribution, forest condition, and carbon storage, and greatly increase the risk to property, natural resources and human life.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to result in substantial ecological impacts across the globe. These impacts are uncertain but there is strong consensus that they will almost certainly affect fire regimes and vegetation. In this study, we evaluated how climate change may influence fire frequency, fire severity, and broad classes of vegetation in mountainous ecoregions of the contiguous western US for early, middle, and late 21st century (2025, 2055, and 2085, respectively). To do so, we employed the concept of a climate analog, whereby specific locations with the best climatic match between one time period and a different time period are identified. For each location (i.e. 1-km2 pixel), we evaluated potential changes by comparing the reference period fire regime and vegetation to that of the fire regime and vegetation of the nearest pixels representative of its future climate. For the mountainous regions we investigated, we found no universal increase or decrease in fire frequency or severity. Instead, potential changes depend on the bioclimatic domain. Specifically, wet and cold regions (i.e. mesic and cold forest) generally exhibited increased fire frequency but decreased fire severity, whereas drier, moisture-limited regions (i.e. shrubland/grassland) displayed the opposite trend. Results also indicate the potential for substantial changes in the amount and distribution of some vegetation types, highlighting important interactions and feedbacks among climate, fire, and vegetation. Our findings also shed light on a potential threshold or tipping point at intermediate moisture conditions that suggest shifts in vegetation from forest to shrubland/grassland are possible as the climate becomes warmer and drier. However, our study assumes that fire and vegetation are in a state of equilibrium with climate, and, consequently, natural and human-induced disequilibrium dynamics should be considered when interpreting our findings.},

  abstract = {In the northern Colorado Front Range, fire suppression during the 20th century is believed to have created a high hazard of catastrophic fire in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Since the early 1990s, resource managers have increased the use of prescribed fires to re-create fire regimes and forest structures similar to those of the pre-Euro-American settlement period in order both to reduce fire hazard and to improve forest health. To improve understanding of historical fire regimes, we conducted a study of fire history along an elevational gradient from {$\sim$}1830 to 2800 m in ponderosa pine forests in the northern Front Range. Fire-scar dates were determined from 525 partial cross sections from living and dead trees at 41 sample sites. Fire frequencies and fire intervals were analyzed in relation to changes in human activities and interannual climatic variability as recorded in instrumental climatic records and tree-ring proxy records. Prior to modern fire suppression, the low elevation, open ponderosa pine forests of the northern Front Range were characterized by frequent surface fires, similar in frequency to many other ponderosa pine ecosystems in the West. In contrast, in higher elevation forests (above {$\sim$}2400 m) where ponderosa pine is mixed with Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the fire regime was characterized by a much lower fire frequency and included extensive stand-replacing fires as well as surface fires. In the mid-1800s there was a marked increase in fire occurrence that can be related both to Euro-American settlement and increased climatic variability. This episode of increased fire left a legacy of dense, even-aged stands in higher elevation ponderosa pine forests, whereas increased stand densities in low elevation forests are attributed mainly to fire exclusion during the 20th century. Warmer and drier spring\textendash{}summers, indicated in instrumental climatic records (1873\textendash{}1995) and in tree-ring proxy records of climate (1600\textendash{}1983), are strongly associated with years of widespread fire. Years of widespread fire also tend to be preceded two to four years by wetter than average springs that increase the production of fine fuels. Alternation of wet and dry periods over time periods of 2\textendash{}5 years is conducive to fire spread and is strongly linked to El Ni\~no\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The warm (El Ni\~no) phase of ENSO is associated with greater moisture availability during spring that results in a peak of fire occurrence several years following El Ni\~no events. Conversely, dry springs associated with La Ni\~na events were followed by more widespread fire during the same year. The 1600\textendash{}1920 fire-scar record indicates that individual years during which high percentages of the 41 sample sites synchronously recorded fire have occurred at least several times per century. The association of these years of widespread fire with very strong ENSO events demonstrates the importance of ENSO-related climatic variabililty in creating extreme fire hazard at a landscape scale.},

The mean presettlement fire interval between 1637 and 1883 was 3.7 yr for all fires and 6.5 yr for widespread fires, but fire has been excluded from the study area since 1883. Forest density increased under fire exclusion from an average of 148 trees/ha in 1883 (65 pines, 80 oaks, three other species), an open forest dominated by relatively large ponderosa pines, to 1265 trees/ha in 1994/1995 (720 pines, 471 oaks, 74 others), a dense forest characterized by relatively small and young trees. Species composition has shifted toward greater dominance by Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and conifers less adapted to frequent fires: white fir (Abies concolor) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The reference presettlement conditions can be applied to management of this ecosystem in two ways. First, reference conditions are a benchmark against which to evaluate contemporary conditions and future alternatives. The comparison shows that the contemporary forest is well above the range of presettlement variability in forest density, and both live and dead fuel structures have developed that can support high-intensity wildfire. Second, reference conditions can serve as a goal for ecological restoration treatments.},

  abstract = {Management of fire is an important and controversial policy issue. Active fire suppression has led to a backlog of fuels, limited the ecological benefits of fire, and reduced short-term smoke impacts likely delaying these emissions to future generations over a larger spatial extent. Smoke impacts can be expected to increase as fire size and intensity increase and the fuel backlog is consumed; whether through reintroduction of fire under desirable conditions or through stand replacing fire. Land Management Agencies would like to increase the use of naturally ignited fires to burn during favorable conditions as a way to reduce catastrophic fires. This study provides information about the levels of air quality impacts expected from these types of fires and discusses some of the policy controversies of managed fire that propagate inconsistencies between agencies and enter the public discourse. The Lion Fire, a primarily low intensity 8,370 ha fire that was extensively monitored for Particulate Matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), is used to quantify impacts to air quality. PM2.5 monitoring sites are used to assess exposure, public health impacts, and subsequently quantify annual air quality during a year with a fire that is within the historic normal fire size and intensity for this area. Ground level PM2.5 impacts were found to be localized with 99\% of the hourly Air Quality Index readings in the moderate or good category for the sites impacted by the fire. PM2.5 concentrations at sites nearest the fire were below annual federal air quality standards for PM2.5 with annual 98th percentile at the most impacted sites (Johnsondale, Kernville, and Camp Nelson) of 35.0, 34.0, and 28.0 mg me3 respectively. Smoke impacts to PM2.5 concentrations were not found to reach the populated Central Valley. The findings suggest that this type of fire can be implemented with minimal public health impacts thus allowing an opportunity for air and fire managers to alter policy to allow additional burning in an area with severe anthropogenic air pollution and where frequent widespread fire is both beneficial and inevitable. The more extensive air quality impacts documented with large high intensity fire may be averted by embracing the use of fire to prevent unwanted high intensity burns. A widespread increase in the use of fire for ecological benefit may provide the resiliency needed in Sierra Nevada forests as well as be the most beneficial to public health through the reduction of single dose exposure to smoke and limiting impacts spatially.},
